# YanuX Desktop Client
This is part of the [__YanuX Framework__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/). 

It is the __Desktop Client__ for the [__YanuX Framework__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/). It incorporates both the __YanuX Orchestrator__ component, by extracting the capabilities of the devices where it runs, and of the role of an __Indoor Positioning Client__ by continuously scanning for __Wi-Fi Access Points__ and __Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons__ (iBeacons) and submitting that information to the [__Indoor Positioning Server__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-IPSServer) so that the devices can be positioned.

This is CLI application that is built using [__Node.js__](https://nodejs.org/), [__Electron__](https://www.electronjs.org/), [__noble__](https://github.com/abandonware/noble), [__node wifi__](https://github.com/friedrith/node-wifi) and many [other packages](package.json).

## Documentation
